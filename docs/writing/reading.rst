Reading Great Code
==================

One of the core tenants behind the design of Python is creating
readable code. The motivation behind this design is simple: The number
one thing that Python programmers do is read code.

One of the secrets of becoming a great Python programmer is to read,
understand, and comprehend excellent code.

Excellent code typically follows the guidelines outlined in
:ref:`code_style`, and does its best to express a clear and concise
intent to the reader.

Included below is a list of recommended Python projects for
reading. Each one of these projects is a paragon of Python coding.

  Howdoi is a code search tool, written in Python.

- `Flask <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/flask>`_
  Flask is a microframework for Python based on Werkzeug and Jinja2.
  It's intended for getting started very quickly and was developed with
  best intentions in mind.

- `Werkzeug <https://github.com/mitsuhiko/werkzeug>`_
