GUI Applications
================


Qt
--
Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing
software with a GUI but can also be used for non-GUI applications.

Gtk
---
PyGTK provides Python bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. Like the GTK+ library
itself, it is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL. It is worth noting that
PyGTK only currenty supports the Gtk-2.X API (NOT Gtk-3.0). It is currently
recommended that PyGTK is not used for new projects and existing applications
be ported from PyGTK to PyGObject.

Tk
--
Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. It has the advantage
of being included with the Python standard library, making it the most
convenient and compatible toolkit to program with.

Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows
and Macintosh systems. Starting with the 8.0 release, Tk offers native look and
feel on all platforms.

There's a good multi-language Tk tutorial with Python examples at
`TkDocs <http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html>`_. There's more information
available on the `Python Wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_.

Kivy
----
Kivy is a Python library for development of multi-touch enabled media rich applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy interaction design and rapid prototyping, while making your code reusable and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python, based on OpenGL and supports different input devices such as: Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, HIDtouch, Apple's products and so on.

Kivy is actively being developed by a community and free to use. It operates on all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows, Android).
