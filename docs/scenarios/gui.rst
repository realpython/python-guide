Gtk
:::
PyGTK provides Python bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. Like the GTK+ library itself, it is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL. It is worth noting that PyGTK only currenty supports the Gtk-2.X API (NOT Gtk-3.0). It is currently recommended that PyGTK is not used for new projects and existing applications be ported from PyGTK to PyGObject.

tk

Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows and Macintosh systems. Starting with the 8.0 release, Tk offers native look and feel on all platforms.
