Alphabetical list of GUI Applications.

Camelot
-------
`Camelot <http://www.python-camelot.com>`_ provides components for building
applications on top of Python, SQLAlchemy and Qt.  It is inspired by
the Django admin interface.

The main resource for information is the website:
http://www.python-camelot.com
and the mailing list https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/project-camelot

Cocoa
-----
.. note:: The Cocoa framework is only available on OS X. Don't pick this if you're writing a cross-platform application!

GTk
---
PyGTK provides Python bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. Like the GTK+ library
itself, it is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL. It is worth noting that
PyGTK only currently supports the Gtk-2.X API (NOT Gtk-3.0). It is currently
recommended that PyGTK not be used for new projects and that existing
applications be ported from PyGTK to PyGObject.

PyGObject aka (PyGi)
--------------------
`PyGObject <https://wiki.gnome.org/Projects/PyGObject>`_ provides Python bindings, which gives access to the entire GNOME software platform.
It is fully compatible with GTK+ 3. Here is a tutorial to get started with `Python GTK+ 3 Tutorial <https://python-gtk-3-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_.

Kivy
----
`Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_ is a Python library for development of multi-touch
enabled media rich applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy
interaction design and rapid prototyping, while making your code reusable
and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python, based on OpenGL and supports different input devices
such as: Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, HIDtouch, Apple's products
and so on.

Kivy is actively being developed by a community and is free to use. It operates
on all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows, Android).

The main resource for information is the website: http://kivy.org

PyObjC
------
.. note:: Only available on OS X. Don't pick this if you're writing a cross-platform application.

PySide
------
PySide is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt.

  pip install pyside

PyQt
----
.. note:: If your software does not fully comply with the GPL you will need a commercial license!

PyQt provides Python bindings for the Qt Framework (see below).

PyjamasDesktop (pyjs Desktop)
-----------------------------
PyjamasDesktop is a port of Pyjamas. PyjamasDesktop is application widget set
for desktop and a cross-platform framework. (After release v0.6 PyjamasDesktop
is a part of Pyjamas (Pyjs)). Briefly, it allows the exact same Python web
application source code to be executed as a standalone desktop application.

Qt
--
`Qt <http://qt-project.org/>`_ is a cross-platform application framework that
is widely used for developing software with a GUI but can also be used for
non-GUI applications.

Tk
--
Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. **It has the advantage
of being included with the Python standard library, making it the most
convenient and compatible toolkit to program with.**

Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows
and Macintosh systems. Starting with the 8.0 release, Tk offers native look and
feel on all platforms.

There's a good multi-language Tk tutorial with Python examples at
`TkDocs <http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html>`_. There's more information
available on the `Python Wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_.

wxPython
--------
wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows
Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional
graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Python
extension module (native code) that wraps the popular wxWidgets cross platform
GUI library, which is written in C++.

**Install (Stable) wxPython**
*go to http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable and download the appropriate
package for your OS.*
