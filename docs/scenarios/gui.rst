GUI Applications
================


Qt
--
Qt is a cross-platform application framework that is widely used for developing
software with a GUI but can also be used for non-GUI applications.

PySide
~~~~~~
PySide is a Python binding of the cross-platform GUI toolkit Qt.

Cocoa
-----
.. note:: The Cocoa framework is only available on Mac OSX. Don't pick this if you're writing a cross-platform application!

PyObjC
~~~~~~
.. note:: Only available on Mac OSX. Don't pick this if you're writing a cross-platform application.

wxPython
--------
wxPython is a GUI toolkit for the Python programming language. It allows
Python programmers to create programs with a robust, highly functional
graphical user interface, simply and easily. It is implemented as a Python
extension module (native code) that wraps the popular wxWidgets cross platform
GUI library, which is written in C++.

Install (Stable)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Go to http://www.wxpython.org/download.php#stable and download the appropriate
package for your OS.*

GTk
---
PyGTK provides Python bindings for the GTK+ toolkit. Like the GTK+ library
itself, it is currently licensed under the GNU LGPL. It is worth noting that
PyGTK only currently supports the Gtk-2.X API (NOT Gtk-3.0). It is currently
recommended that PyGTK not be used for new projects and existing applications
be ported from PyGTK to PyGObject.

Tk
--
Tkinter is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. It has the advantage
of being included with the Python standard library, making it the most
convenient and compatible toolkit to program with.

Both Tk and Tkinter are available on most Unix platforms, as well as on Windows
and Macintosh systems. Starting with the 8.0 release, Tk offers native look and
feel on all platforms.

There's a good multi-language Tk tutorial with Python examples at
`TkDocs <http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html>`_. There's more information
available on the `Python Wiki <http://wiki.python.org/moin/TkInter>`_.

Kivy
----
`Kivy <http://kivy.org>`_ is a Python library for development of multi-touch
enabled media rich applications. The aim is to allow for quick and easy
interaction design and rapid prototyping, while making your code reusable
and deployable.

Kivy is written in Python, based on OpenGL and supports different input devices
such as: Mouse, Dual Mouse, TUIO, WiiMote, WM_TOUCH, HIDtouch, Apple's products and so on.

Kivy is actively being developed by a community and free to use. It operates
on all major platforms (Linux, OSX, Windows, Android).
