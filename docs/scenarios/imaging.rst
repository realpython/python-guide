    Add introduction about image manipulation and its Python libraries.

Python Imaging Library
----------------------

The `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, or PIL
for short, is *the* library for image manipulation in Python.

It works with Python 1.5.2 and above, including 2.5, 2.6 and 2.7. Unfortunately,
it doesn't work with 3.0+ yet. 

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

PIL has a reputation of not being very straightforward to install. Listed below
are installation notes on various systems.

Also, there's a fork named [Pillow](pypi.python.org/pypi/Pillow) which is easier 
to install. It has good setup instructions for all platforms.
