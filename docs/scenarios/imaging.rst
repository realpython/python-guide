    Add introduction about image manipulation and its Python libraries.

Python Imaging Library
----------------------

The `Python Imaging Library <http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/>`_, or PIL
for short, is *the* library for image manipulation in Python. Unfortunately,
its development has stagnated, with its last release in 2009.

Luckily for you, there's an actively-developed fork of PIL called
`Pillow <http://python-pillow.github.io/>`_ - it's easier to install, runs on
all operating systems, and supports Python 3.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before installing Pillow, you'll have to install Pillow's prerequisites. Find
the instructions for your platform
`here <http://pillow.readthedocs.org/installation.html>`_.

After that, it's straightforward:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install Pillow
