Introduction
============

From the `official Python website <http://python.org/about/>`_:

Python is a general-purpose, high-level programming language similar
to Tcl, Perl, Ruby, Scheme, or Java. Some of its main key features
include:

* very clear, readable syntax

  Python's philosophy focuses on readability, from code blocks
  delineated with significant whitespace to intuitive keywords in
  place of inscrutable punctuation

* extensive standard libraries and third party modules for virtually
  any task

  Python is sometimes described with the words "batteries included"
  for its extensive
  `standard library <http://docs.python.org/library/>`_, which can
  includes modules for regular expressions, file IO, fraction handling,
  object serialization, and much more.

  Additionally, the
  `Python Package Index <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/>`_ is available
  for users to submit their packages for widespread use, similar to
  Perl's `CPAN <http://www.cpan.org>`_. There is a thriving community
  of very powerful Python frameworks and tools like
  the `Django <http://www.djangoproject.com>`_ web framework and the
  `NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org>`_ set of math routines.

* integration with other systems

  Python can integrate with `Java libraries <http://www.jython.org>`_,
  enabling it to be used with the rich Java environment that corporate
  programmers are used to. It can also be
  `extended by C or C++ modules <http://docs.python.org/extending/>`_
  when speed is of the essence.

* ubiquity on computers

  Python is available on Windows, \*nix, and Mac. It runs wherever the
  Java virtual machine runs, and the reference implementation CPython
  can help bring Python to wherever there is a working C compiler.

* friendly community

  Python has a vibrant and large :ref:`community <the-community>`
  which maintains wikis, conferences, countless repositories,
  mailing lists, IRC channels, and so much more. Heck, the Python
  community is even helping to write this guide!

About This Guide
----------------

Purpose
~~~~~~~

The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python exists to provide both novice and expert
Python developers a best-practice handbook to the installation, configuration,
and usage of Python on a daily basis.


By the Community
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This guide is architected and maintained by `Kenneth Reitz
<https://github.com/kennethreitz>`_ in an open fashion. This is a
community-driven effort that serves one purpose: to serve the community.

For the Community

If you think there's a gap in what the Guide covers, fork the Guide on
GitHub and submit a pull request. Contributions are welcome from everyone,
whether they're an old hand or a first-time Pythonista, and the authors to
the Guide will gladly help if you have any questions about the
appropriateness, completeness, or accuracy of a contribution.
