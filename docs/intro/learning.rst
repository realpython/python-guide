with plenty of exercises, minimal jargon and a section in each chapter devoted
to the subject of debugging.

While exploring the various features available in the Python language the
author weaves in various design patterns and best practices.

The book also includes several case studies which have the reader explore the
topics discussed in the book in greater detail by applying those topics to
real-world examples. Case studies include assignments in GUI and Markov
Analysis.

test script, this provides sequential steps to learning Python.

For those used to languages and figuring out puzzles on their own, this can be
a fun, attractive option. For those new to Python and programming, having an
additional resource or reference will be helpful.
