Properly Installing Python
==========================

There's a good chance that you already have Python on your operating system.

If so, you do not need to install or configure anything else to use Python.
Having said that, I would strongly recommend that you install the tools and
libraries described in the guides below before you start building Python
applications for real-world use. In particular, you should always install
Setuptools, Pip, and Virtualenv — they make it much easier for you to use
other third-party Python libraries.
