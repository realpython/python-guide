The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python!
=================================

Greetings, Earthling! Welcome to The Hitchhiker's Guide to Python.

**This is a living, breathing guide.**  If you'd like to contribute,
`fork us on GitHub <https://github.com/kennethreitz/python-guide>`_!

This handcrafted guide exists to provide both novice and expert Python
developers a best practice handbook to the installation, configuration, and
usage of Python on a daily basis.

This guide is **opinionated** in a way that is almost, but not quite, entirely
*unlike* Python's official documentation. You won't find a list of every Python web framework
available here. Rather, you'll find a nice concise list of highly recommended
options.

.. note:: The use of **Python 3** is *highly* preferred over Python 2. Consider upgrading your applications and infrastructure if you find yourself *still* using Python 2 in production today. If you are using Python 3, congratulations — you are indeed a person of excellent taste.

Let's get started! But first, let's make sure you know where your towel is.
