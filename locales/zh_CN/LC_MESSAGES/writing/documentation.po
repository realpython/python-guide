"*Do not use triple-quote strings to comment code*. This is not a good "

"Additionally, Doctest_ will read all embedded docstrings that look like "
"input from the Python commandline (prefixed with \">>>\") and run them, "
"checking to see if the output of the command matches the text on the "
"following line. This allows developers to embed real examples and usage "
"of functions alongside their source code. As a side effect, it also "

msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:172
msgid ""
"These aren't interchangeable. For a function or class, the leading "
"comment block is a programmer's note. The docstring describes the "
"*operation* of the function or class:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:183
msgid ""
"Unlike block comments, docstrings are built into the Python language "
"itself. This means you can use all of Python's powerful introspection "
"capabilities to access docstrings at runtime, compared with comments "
"which are optimized out. Docstrings are accessible from both the "
"`__doc__` dunder attribute for almost every Python object, as well as "
"with the built in `help()` function."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:189
msgid ""
"While block comments are usually used to explain *what* a section of code"
" is doing, or the specifics of an algorithm, docstrings are more intended"
" towards explaining other users of your code (or you in 6 months time) "
"*how* a particular function can be used and the general purpose of a "
"function, class, or module."

"Depending on the complexity of the function, method, or class being "
"written, a one-line docstring may be perfectly appropriate. These are "
"generally used for really obvious cases, such as::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:206
msgid ""
"The docstring should describe the function in a way that is easy to "
"understand. For simple cases like trivial functions and classes, simply "
"embedding the function's signature (i.e. `add(a, b) -> result`) in the "
"docstring is unnecessary. This is because with Python's `inspect` module,"
" it is already quite easy to find this information if needed, and it is "
"also readily available by reading the source code."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:213
msgid ""
"In larger or more complex projects however, it is often a good idea to "
"give more information about a function, what it does, any exceptions it "
"may raise, what it returns, or relevant details about the parameters."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:217
msgid ""
"For more detailed documentation of code a popular style used, is the one "
"used by the NumPy project, often called `NumPy style`_ docstrings. While "
"it can take up more lines than the previous example, it allows the "
"developer to include a lot more information about a method, function, or "
"class. ::"
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:243
msgid ""
"The `sphinx.ext.napoleon`_ plugin allows Sphinx to parse this style of "
"docstrings, making it easy to incorporate NumPy style docstrings into "
"your project."
msgstr ""

#: ../../writing/documentation.rst:247
msgid ""
"At the end of the day, it doesn't really matter what style is used for "
"writing docstrings; their purpose is to serve as documentation for anyone"
" who may need to read or make changes to your code. As long as it is "
"correct, understandable, and gets the relevant points across then it has "
"done the job it was designed to do."
