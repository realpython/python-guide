"Python is frequently used for high-performance scientific applications. "
"It is widely used in academia and scientific projects because it is easy "
"to write and performs well."

"Due to its high performance nature, scientific computing in Python often "
"utilizes external libraries, typically written in faster languages (like "
"C, or Fortran for matrix operations). The main libraries used are "
"`NumPy`_, `SciPy`_ and `Matplotlib`_. Going into detail about these "
"libraries is beyond the scope of the Python guide. However, a "
"comprehensive introduction to the scientific Python ecosystem can be "
"found in the `Python Scientific Lecture Notes <http://scipy-"
"lectures.github.com/>`_."

"`IPython <http://ipython.org/>`_ is an enhanced version of Python "
"interpreter, which provides features of great interest to scientists. The"
" `inline mode` allows graphics and plots to be displayed in the terminal "
"(Qt based version). Moreover, the `notebook` mode supports literate "
"programming and reproducible science generating a web-based Python "
"notebook. This notebook allows you to store chunks of Python code "
"alongside the results and additional comments (HTML, LaTeX, Markdown). "
"The notebook can then be shared and exported in various file formats."

#: ../../scenarios/scientific.rst:50
msgid ""
"`NumPy <http://numpy.scipy.org/>`_ is a low level library written in C "
"(and Fortran) for high level mathematical functions. NumPy cleverly "
"overcomes the problem of running slower algorithms on Python by using "
"multidimensional arrays and functions that operate on arrays. Any "
"algorithm can then be expressed as a function on arrays, allowing the "
"algorithms to be run quickly."

"NumPy is part of the SciPy project, and is released as a separate library"
