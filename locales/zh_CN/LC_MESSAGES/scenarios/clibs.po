"`CFFI <https://cffi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ provides a simple to use"
" mechanism for interfacing with C from both CPython and PyPy. It supports"
" two modes: an inline `ABI <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2171177"
"/what-is-an-application-binary-interface-abi>`_ compatibility mode "
"(example provided below), which allows you to dynamically load and run "
"functions from executable modules (essentially exposing the same "
"functionality as `LoadLibrary <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-"
"us/windows/desktop/api/libloaderapi/nf-libloaderapi-loadlibrarya>`_ or "
"`dlopen <https://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/C++-dlopen/index.html>`_), and an API"
" mode, which allows you to build C extension modules."

"`ctypes <https://docs.python.org/3/library/ctypes.html>`_ is the de facto"
" standard library for interfacing with C/C++ from CPython, and it "
"provides not only full access to the native C interface of most major "
"operating systems (e.g., kernel32 on Windows, or libc on \\*nix), but "
"also provides support for loading and interfacing with dynamic libraries,"
" such as DLLs or shared objects, at runtime. It brings along with it a "
"whole host of types for interacting with system APIs, and allows you to "
"rather easily define your own complex types, such as structs and unions, "
"and allows you to modify things such as padding and alignment, if needed."
" It can be a bit crufty to use, but in conjunction with the `struct "
"<https://docs.python.org/3/library/struct.html>`_ module, you are "
"essentially provided full control over how your data types get translated"
" into something usable by a pure C/C++ method."

"`SWIG <http://www.swig.org>`_, though not strictly Python focused (it "
"supports a large number of scripting languages), is a tool for generating"
" bindings for interpreted languages from C/C++ header files. It is "
"extremely simple to use: the consumer simply needs to define an interface"
" file (detailed in the tutorial and documentations), include the "
"requisite C/C++ headers, and run the build tool against them. While it "
"does have some limits (it currently seems to have issues with a small "
"subset of newer C++ features, and getting template-heavy code to work can"
" be a bit verbose), it provides a great deal of power and exposes lots of"
" features to Python with little effort. Additionally, you can easily "
"extend the bindings SWIG creates (in the interface file) to overload "
"operators and built-in methods, effectively re- cast C++ exceptions to be"
" catchable by Python, etc."
