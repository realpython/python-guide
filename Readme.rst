============================

**Python Best Practices Guidebook**

-----------

**Work in progress. If you'd like to help, please do. There's a lot of work to
be done.**

This guide is currently under heavy development. This opinionated guide
exists to provide both novice and expert Python developers a best practice
handbook to the installation, configuration, and usage of Python on a daily
basis.


Topics include:

- Platform- and version-specific installations
- Py2app, Py2exe, bbfreeze, pyInstaller
- Pip
- Numpy, scipy, statpy, pylot, matlib
- Virtualenv
- Fabric
- Exhaustive module recommendations, grouped by topic/purpose
- Which libraries to use for what
- Server configurations & tools for various web frameworks
- Documentation: writing it
- Testing: Jenkins & tox guides
- How to easily interface ``hg`` from ``git``

If you aren't fond of reading reStructuredText, there is an
almost up-to-date `HTML version at docs.python-guide.org
<http://docs.python-guide.org>`_.
